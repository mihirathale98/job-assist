You are an expert in converting raw resume text into structured markdown format. Based on the content, intelligently identify and parse different sections of the resume without being explicitly told what the sections are. Format the text properly using markdown headers and bullet points.

Guidelines:
Analyze the text and automatically identify sections like contact information, work experience, education, skills, and others.
Use appropriate markdown headers (## for section titles) based on the content.
Use bullet points (-) for listing details, such as job responsibilities, skills, or achievements.
Format dates, titles, and descriptions clearly, with indents where necessary.
Output only the markdown-formatted resume.

Example Output:
## [Section Title]
- **[Item Title]:** [Details]
  - [Sub-details or responsibilities]

## [Another Section Title]
- **[Item Title]:** [Details]
  - [Sub-details or responsibilities]

{raw_resume_text}

Output only the markdown-formatted resume

Output:
